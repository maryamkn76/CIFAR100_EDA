#The CIFAR-100 dataset is a collection of 60,000 32x32 color images in 100 different classes, with 600 images per class. In this repository, I did process of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) helps us to visualize the data distribution. The steps are:
1-Data Loading
2-Statistical Analysis(count,samples per class,class number)
3-visualize some random samples
4-Statistical analysis(pixel average,min, max,histogram)
